# Server-creation-and-maintenance-using-python

I was recently in the proccess of designing and creating a BaaS server and subsequently searched a lot in order to find the easiest way to create and maintain it while keeping /// in mind. Remember that servers do not have a GUI and unless you are really familiar using the terminal you are gonna have a hard time finding what's going on. Which is bad in production scenarios because downtime or slow implementation of features/changes equals to loss of money and user dissatifaction.

This guide is what I wished was out there when I was desperately searching so... LUCKY YOU!
